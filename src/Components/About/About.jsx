        <p>
          Sponsored research and Industrial consultancy projects are an
          essential means of enhancing institution-industry interaction and
          faculty development. By supporting the Govt, PSU and the industry, the
          University intends to contribute towards the countryâ€™s economic growth
          and serve the society. Therefore, as a matter of policy, the
          University encourages its faculty members to undertake scientific and
          technical research/collaboration and consultancy work with outside
          agencies.
