# INDUSTRIAL & RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT - DELHI TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY


Delhi Technological University (hereafter remarked as 'DTU') is a University that continuously strives to attain academic excellence in teaching and research in the domain of Science, Engineering, Technology, Economics and Management. Its actions and pursuits are targeted upon faculty/students/project staff/ supporting staff/ visitors and are based on knowledge and conversance. As twenty first century is known to be administered by technological advancements, where values and perspicacity change in the blink of an eye, the system demands the technological institutions to preserve the primary sense of academics & research on one hand and on the other side, accept the dynamic horizons of entrepreneurship and business economy on the grounds of knowledge generated, protected and distributed under the intellectual property Regime. Because the world these days is incredibly dynamic and there's an increasing awareness of the 'knowledge asset', an intellectual property Rights (IPR) Policy is needed not only to protect the concerns of DTU but additionally to make DTU faculty/students/supporting staff/ project staff/visitors alert regarding 'knowledge asset and its impact on the society'.

The present policy ensures the protection of the claims of the Inventor(s) of DTU i.e. faculty/students/ supporting staff/ project staff/ visitors of DTU through the choice of intellectual property protection on a completely unique work, ideas, inventions, products, technology or to keep it open for public domain, whichever they find appropriate. In accordance with the Mission and Vision of DTU, the policy stands with the outreach of the innovative technologies developed at DTU. The policy also motivates the Researchers, Faculty and Students of DTU to induct technology sharing using the intellectual property Rights gained over a completely unique technology.
